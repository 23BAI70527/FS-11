This project is based on React component-based development, where the UI is broken into reusable components:

Navbar: Displays the application title.

Dashboard: Shows key metrics using styled cards.

Form: Collects user information using Material UI components.

CSS is embedded directly within components to keep styling localized and manageable. Bootstrap is used for grid layout and responsiveness.

🔹 Project Description

The application consists of three main sections:

Navbar at the top for branding.

Dashboard section showing cards for Users, Sales, and Revenue.

Form section allowing users to enter name and email.

The layout is responsive and visually enhanced using gradients, hover effects, and Material UI components.
